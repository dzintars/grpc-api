# Private sandbox project of some coding newbie :)

## This is strongly my coding learning sandbox project and you should not pay attention to it.

Main intention of creating this repo is to make research and collect samples about real-time event-sourced (CQRS) web application architecture and good practices.
In simple words, I want to explore distributed ERP style application architecture where users can collaborate real-time by leveraging Redux, Websockets, ProtoBufs, Kafka and MySQL for materialized views.

Front-end part are hosted in separate repo and will be published as boilerplate when I will be satisfied with its architecture.
Currently for front-end I am using:

- Web Components (LitElement)
- Redux
- Redux Sagas
- Reselect
- TypeScript
- WebPack
- SCSS

Still open Q. is about HTML form handling.
Looking at - https://github.com/corpusculejs/corpuscule/tree/master/packages/form

It is not guaranteed that this repo will live long life.
